calculates a simple ratio between two strings

Args:

    s2 (str): second string to compare
    processor (Union[bool, Callable]): optional callable that reformats the strings.
        None is used by default.
    score_cutoff (float): Optional argument for a score threshold as a float between 0 and 100.
        For ratio < score_cutoff 0 is returned instead. Defaults to 0.

Returns:
    float: ratio between s1 and s2 as a float between 0 and 100

Example:
