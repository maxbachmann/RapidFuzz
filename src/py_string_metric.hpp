--

Calculates the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions
required to change one sequence into the other according to Levenshtein with custom
costs for insertion, deletion and substitution

Args:
    s1 (str):  first string to compare
    s2 (str):  second string to compare
    insert_cost (int): cost for insertions
    delete_cost (int): cost for deletions
    replace_cost (int): cost for substitutions

Returns:
    int: weighted levenshtein distance between s1 and s2
)");

--

Calculates a normalized levenshtein distance using custom
costs for insertion, deletion and substitution. So far only the following
combinations are supported:
- insert_cost= 1, delete_cost = 1, replace_cost = 1
- insert_cost= 1, delete_cost = 1, replace_cost = 2

further combinations will be supported in the future

Args:
    s1 (str):  first string to compare
    s2 (str):  second string to compare
    insert_cost (int): cost for insertions
    delete_cost (int): cost for deletions
    replace_cost (int): cost for substitutions
    processor (Union[bool, Callable]): optional callable that reformats the strings.
        None is used by default.
    score_cutoff (float): Optional argument for a score threshold as a float between 0 and 100.
        For ratio < score_cutoff 0 is returned instead. Defaults to 0.

Returns:
    float: normalized weighted levenshtein distance between s1 and s2 as a float between 0 and 100
