## [0.3.2] - 2020 Mar 29

### Added

## [0.3.1] - 2020 Mar 27

### Changed

## [0.3.0] - 2020 Mar 26

### Changed
- When using score_cutoff there is now a guarantee that it returns 0 when result < score_cutoff
- each function has now a preprocess argument to specify whether strings should be preprocessed
